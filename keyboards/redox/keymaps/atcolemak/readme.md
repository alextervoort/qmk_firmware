# A Colemak/Querty keymap for the Redox keyboard

A mix of the default keymap with colmak layout from jeherve's keymap
Qwerty and Colemak layers 

## Layers

My keymap now has 4 layers:

1. The default layer uses [Colemak](https://colemak.com/)
2. A qwerty layer 
3. A Symbol/Numpad layer
4. A Navigation/Media layer, with both sound control and arrows on the home row
