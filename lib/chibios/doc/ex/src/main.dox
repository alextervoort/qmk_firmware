 * <h2>Features</h2>
 * - EXternal devices (EX) supporting numerous devices external to the MCU
 *   abstracting common devices which are part of modern embedded systems.
 * - EX resides on top of HAL which offers, among others, a set of abstract 
 *   interfaces like Generic Sensor, Gyroscope, Magnetometer, Accelerometer,
 *   Barometer, Thermometer: EX offers a phisical implementation of them.
 * - Currently STMicroelectronics supported devices are:
 *    - @b HTS221: Capacitive digital humidity sensor;
 *    - @b L3GD20: 3-axis digital gyroscope; 
 *    - @b LIS3DSH: 3-axis digital motion sensor;
 *    - @b LIS3MDL: Ultra low power, high performances 3-axis magnetometer;
 *    - @b LIS302DL: 3-axis motion sensor;
 *    - @b LPS25H: Piezoresistive 260-1260 hPa pressure sensor; 
 *    - @b LSM6DS0: 6-axis iNEMO inertial module; 
 *    - @b LSM303DLHC: Ultra compact high performance e-compass;
